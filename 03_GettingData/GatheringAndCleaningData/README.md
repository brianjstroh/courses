## Files:
CodeBook.md - describes the methods used to tidy the source data.  
README.md - describes each of the repository's files.  
run_analysis.R - the R script for transforming the source data to the tidy output.  
run_analysis_output - an R object containing the output data frame. This can be loaded into R using the load() function.  
run_analysis_output.txt - a comma separated file containing the tidy output. This can be used for easy visualization of the output or with other data manipulation applications.  

## Running the run_analysis R script:
-Download and open run_analysis.R in RStudio.  
-Ensure that the tidyr, dyplr, plyr and reshape2 packages are installed before running.  
-You will also want to make sure that you have 100 mb of space available on the hard drive for the source and output data.  
-Select and run the entire script.  
-Find your run_analysis_output(.txt) files in your working directory.
